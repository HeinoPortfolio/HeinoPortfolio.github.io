      <h2><span class=info>What am I currently doing?</span></h2>
      <p>
        I am currently studying to take a certification exam for an entry-level Python programmer. This certification will be used to bolster my credentials when it comes to programming in this language.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the near future I am looking to receive a professional certificate from Google in data analytics and one from IBM.  I feel these would be beneficial to me in my future career goals.  I think my skills as a programmer will be put to great use in this field.

      <h2><span class=info>What aspects are you most passionate about?</span></h2>
      <p>
        I feel that I am most passionate about learning new things.  I enjoy the learning process. I do not mind learning things on my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, I sometimes prefer this.  I find that I can go at my own speed and learn the subject or topic at a much greater depth.  I like learning as much as I can about a topic.  I do not settle for just a cursory understanding of it.  I want to know what makes things tick.

    <div class="info">
      <h2><span class=info>What do I consider some of my biggest professional and personal accomplishments?</span></h2>
      <p>
        My biggest accomplishments lie in my academic career.  I graduated from The City University of New York summa cum laude with a GPA of 3.97.  My other great accomplishment is graduating from WGU in about nine months.
      </p>

    <div class="info">
      <h2><span class=info>What am I looking for right now?</span></h2>
      <p>
        The component that I am looking for right is a job in which I can use my varied talents in programming and data management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to make use of these as I see these abilities as complimentary, and I would like to use them to the best possible means.
