        The island of Mattiti is a tropical island located in the warm waters of the Pacific.
        The island is about 500 square miles.  The island is microcosm of different types of
        terrains from our mountainous highlands to the beautiful white sand beaches.
        <br><br>
        We have excellent weather all year round.  We have an abundance of fishing
        and other natural resources that make the island an exquisite place
        to visit.  We have harbor and beautiful bays where you can snorkel and
        other activities in peace and calm.

        <h1>Transportation</h1>
        <br>
        The island is easy to get to from the mainland United States. You can
        arrive via plane or by a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow
        Leaf bay once a week.  You can also arrive by small plane via our small
        airport.

          numerous taxis to take you where you need to go.  If you would like

          excellent opportunity to bike.  Traffic is almost non-existent and we
          have bike rentals available.  Often the most enjoyable way to get
          around the island and the city is by walking.  The island is fairly
