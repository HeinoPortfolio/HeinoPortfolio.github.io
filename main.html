    		    I consider myself to be a beginner programmer and always will.  I say this because I believe that in the field of programming there is so much
            	to learn and the technology changes so often.  I feel that I am always starting from the beginning.  I do not think that is a bad thing.  I 			feel that the more I learn about one language or concept it makes it even easier to learn others.
    	<p>
    		I am a summa cum laude graduate from The City University of New York - School of Professional Studies. Where I received a bachelor's degree in Information Systems. I attended Three Rivers Community College where I received an associate's degree in Computer Science Technology. </p>
    	<p>
    	 During my academic career I have studied multiple programming languages. I have studied languages like Python, Java and C++ through most of my academic career.  I have learned others through self-learning.  These languages 			include, but not limited to, PHP, C# and a few others.  I will include a portfolio for each as I make them ready for the repository.   You 			can find the links to them on the lefthand side of the screen.  The repositories will have a few different levels to them and include a myriad 			of work.  These include from the very easy to the complex.  I will write some programs in a couple of different languages just to get a feel 			of the nuances between the different ways of doing the same task but in a different language.
